# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of MiFlasher pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### ✅ Behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being respectful** — Treat everyone with kindness and professionalism, even in disagreement
- **Being constructive** — Offer helpful feedback, not just criticism
- **Being inclusive** — Welcome people of all experience levels; we were all beginners once
- **Being patient** — Not everyone speaks English as a first language or has the same technical background
- **Giving credit** — Acknowledge others' contributions and ideas
- **Focusing on the issue, not the person** — Critique code and ideas, never the contributor
- **Accepting feedback gracefully** — Receiving critique is part of open source; don't take it personally
- **Helping others learn** — Share knowledge generously

### ❌ Behavior that is not acceptable:

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks of any kind
- Sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, deliberate provocation, or inflammatory comments
- Publishing others' private information (doxxing)
- Dismissing or belittling questions based on perceived skill level
- Spamming issues, PRs, or discussions
- Threats of any kind
- Any conduct that would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all MiFlasher community spaces, including:

- GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and comments
- The project's web presence and documentation
- Any events or meetups related to MiFlasher
- Private communications when representing the project

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces (e.g., using an official project email, posting from an official account, or acting as a designated representative at an event).

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior, please report it to the maintainers:

- **GitHub:** Open a private [Security Advisory](https://github.com/djunekz/miflasher/security/advisories/new) (we will repurpose it for CoC reports)
- **Email:** conduct [Developer MiFlasher](gab288.gab288@passinbox.com)

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. You will not be retaliated against for reporting in good faith.

**What to include in a report:**
- Your contact information (for follow-up, kept confidential)
- Names or usernames of those involved
- Description of the incident
- Links to relevant content (issue, PR, comment URLs)
- Any other context that may be helpful

### Response Process

Maintainers will:
1. Acknowledge your report within 48 hours
2. Review the incident and gather additional context if needed
3. Determine what action is appropriate
4. Notify you of the outcome

### Enforcement Guidelines

We follow a graduated response based on severity and context:

#### 1. Correction
**For:** Minor violations — inappropriate language, off-topic posts, unintentional rudeness

**Action:** Private message from a maintainer explaining the issue and requesting a behavior change. Public clarification may be posted if needed.

---

#### 2. Warning
**For:** A clear violation, or a pattern of minor violations after correction

**Action:** Formal warning with specific consequences for continued behavior. Temporary restriction on interactions may be applied.

---

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**For:** Serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior or harassment

**Action:** Temporary ban from all community interactions for a defined period (typically 7–30 days). No interaction with the community or project is allowed during this time.

---

#### 4. Permanent Ban
**For:** Demonstrating a pattern of serious violations, sustained harassment, or behavior fundamentally incompatible with community values

**Action:** Permanent removal from the community with no path to reinstatement.

---

## Appeals

If you believe a moderation decision was made in error, you may appeal by contacting the maintainers with:

- The specific decision you are appealing
- Why you believe it was incorrect
- Any context or evidence you'd like us to consider

Appeals will be reviewed by a maintainer who was not involved in the original decision.

---

## For Maintainers

Maintainers are held to a **higher standard** than general community members. In addition to following this Code of Conduct as community members, maintainers must:

- Apply the guidelines fairly and consistently
- Recuse themselves from decisions where they have a conflict of interest
- Maintain confidentiality in enforcement discussions
- Act in the best interest of the community, not personal preferences

Maintainers who violate this Code of Conduct may face consequences including removal of maintainer status.
